This file contains an overview of the design, and critical tasks of the entire project.

Consideration:
  <empty>

Tasks:
	✔ Instead of storing references, store (specific) keys. Retrieve using these keys. @done
	☐ Begin laying out foundations to allow for concurrency during processing phases such as semantic checking, code generation, and others.
	☐ Setup environment for integration testing.
  ☐ Merge the driver project into this project. They should be placed in individual crates.

Revisions:
	☐ Use the `code_span` crate instead of `DiagnosticBuilder`. This will also remove the need for the `diagnostic.rs` module.

Design:
	✘ Should lazy-evaluation design be changed to eager-evaluation? Eager evaluation removes the need for node retrieval from the cache. However, this would require more analysis before lowering. @cancelled
	✘ Is there a way to have lazy-evaluation without needing the cache? @cancelled
	✘ Should the cache be a singleton? This would remove the need for the cache to be passed around. @cancelled
	☐ Should the cache contain unresolved node copies, or must they be resolved?
	☐ Revise current design flaws. These might include, for example, the unsafe retrieval from the cache, among others.
	☐ Consider deferring responsability of functions that assume, and use unsafe retrieval, and instead abstracting it to their consumers (separation of concerns). The tradeoff of more boilerplate might apply.
	✔ Create a flowchart of the ideal system's process and design. @done
	✘ Should a typed-AST be implemented and used? @cancelled
  ☐ Consider having a workspace-concious design. This would simplify processing by the multiple phases.
